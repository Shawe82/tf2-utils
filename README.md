# Some tf2 utils
Unfortunately, poetry and tensorflow 2 do not work together  yet. However, all you have to do is run
```bash
poetry run pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-rc1
```
This is certainly not optimal but works. I hope I will remove this note and you will never have to read it as they 
have resovled the issue :).
